1. @RestController

A specialized controller in Spring.

Combination of:

@Controller (marks class as a Spring MVC controller)

@ResponseBody (tells Spring to return the method result directly in the HTTP response body instead of looking for a view/template).

2. @RequestMapping

A general-purpose mapping annotation.

Can be used at class level and method level.

Defines the URL path and optionally the HTTP method.

3. @GetMapping

A shortcut for @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET).

Used when you want an endpoint to respond only to HTTP GET requests.
