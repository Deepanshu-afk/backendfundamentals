ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a technique that lets developers interact with a database using Java objects instead of writing raw SQL queries.

It maps Java classes (objects) to database tables, and class fields to table columns.

Simplifies Database Access
Write Java code instead of SQL for CRUD operations.
Example: userRepository.save(user); instead of INSERT INTO users ....

Improves Productivity
Less boilerplate SQL, faster development.

Database Independence
Same Java code can work with different databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle) with minimal changes.

Automatic Mapping
Java objects ↔ database rows are handled automatically.

Maintainability
Cleaner, object-oriented code that’s easier to maintain.
