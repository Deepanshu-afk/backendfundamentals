What is Rest APIs?

Rest APIs(Representation State Transfer APIs) is used to design a networking application.
It helps in communication of different applications.
It allows communication between a server and a client using http methods like GET, PUT, DELETE, POST. Rest APIs are stateless,
 scalable and resource oriented,
which makes widely used iin development.

5 key principles of Rest APIs are :

1) Stateless :- Each request by the browser contains all the information that is needed to understand and process the request.

2) Client-Server separation :- The client and server both are independent. The client handles all the request and server handles the
  information.

3) Cacheability :- The responses define themselves as cacheable and non-cacheable which improves performance and scalability.

4) Layered system :- Rest API can be defined in layers where each does not need to know the full architecture. It just interacts with
  its adjacent layer.

5) REST APIs follow a consistent, standardized way of interacting with resources.
  Typically achieved through:
  Resource identification (via URIs)
  Manipulation through representations (e.g., JSON, XML)
  Self-descriptive messages (clear HTTP status codes, headers)
