SQL Databases (Relational Databases)

Structure: Data is stored in tables (rows & columns).

Schema: Fixed, predefined schema (you must define columns and types before inserting data).

Relationships: Use foreign keys to connect tables.

Queries: Use SQL (Structured Query Language).

Use Case: Best for structured data and complex queries (e.g., banking, ERP, CRM).

Examples:
MySQL
PostgreSQL


ðŸ”¹ NoSQL Databases (Non-Relational Databases)

Structure: Flexible, can be document-based, key-value, column-based, or graph-based.

Schema: Schema-less or dynamic schema (you can insert data without predefined structure).

Scalability: Designed for horizontal scaling (big data, distributed systems).

Queries: Use JSON-like queries, key lookups, or custom APIs instead of SQL.

Use Case: Best for unstructured or rapidly changing data (e.g., social media, IoT, real-time apps).

Examples:
MongoDB (Document-oriented, JSON-like storage)
Cassandra (Wide-column store, used in distributed systems)
